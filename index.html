              Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are
              continuously placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so
              one should never be too far away.

            <p>
              We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you.
              So you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how
              much it will cost.

            <p>
              Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock,
              put on a helmet, and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from
              walkways and accessibility ramps.

            <p>
              The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it
              can show you your average speed, how long you've been using the
              scooter, your traveling distance, and many more things all in an
              easy to use app.
